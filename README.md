# OverseerV2

The second iteration of the Overseer games.

The database dump can be found at `database.sql`. Here, it's the master branch that contains the last official live version.

There's a `.env.dist` you can fill out a `.env` from.

Remember to run `composer install`.

The repository also contains the status of the then upcoming Overseer v2.5, on the dev branch and a couple of feature branches.

Godspeed.
