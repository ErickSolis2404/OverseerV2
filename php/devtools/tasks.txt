To complete this release:
- [IMPORTANT] Remove dungeon enemies left when exiting it.
- Add Magnetic ability (affects metallic grist underlings. "affects", and "metallic" up for debate)
- Temporary boosts for aspect patterns
- Two missing Denizen abilities (Hephaestus and ?Nix?)
- Generally sort out Denizen fights so that they are not trivial
-- Add no assisting provision
-- Add "empty effects field" provision
- One missing tier II fraymotif (Hope II)
- multiple abstrati
- abstratus resets (conditional, maybe ignore and just allow people to get new ones)
- Add a flag to the database that, if set, stops anyone with a mod level of less than 99 from accessing the game
- Rogue roletech: Siphon, but distributes boosts out instead of holding them for self
- Add the stock exchange? (If there's time)
- Fix issue: Metis spamming invuln and not doing anything else, also damaging through high power maybe??
- Fix Art Submitter interface
- Add random session feature
- Add a character per account limit (something like 12)

Random events:
- <insert carapace here> acquires BQ's ring. They appear in random strifes throughout the session, have a suite of standard abilities plus one or two specifics to whoever they actually are
- <insert carapace here> acquires BK's scepter. They replace the final boss, same story
- WK dies unexpectedly. Everyone gets Battlefield access instantly, and you sorry people have 24 hours to coordinate a BK fight.
-- Only possible if everyone is max rung
-- Might be part of a bigger system that tracks the Battlefields status and assigns a chance to it based on how that is going
- Timeline Madness: A copy of the session's Time player shows up and goes berserk for reasons unknown (hint: they came from a doomed timeline and bad things happened there). Only occurs in sessions with a Time player.
- Session glitches out (The Bug shows up, GLITCHED statuses everywhere, stuff gets replaced with 44444444 - ERROR CODE)
- Characters become aware of their nature as characters in a video game. High correlation with glitched-out session.
- Someone gets their hands on a Trickster Juju. Don't ask how.
- The Dersites decide to raid someone's Land. Battleships fly over there and shit happens
- Something with grimdark maybe?
-- autopilot actions are kinda tricky. I'd rather feed the affected player misinformation so they do stupid things.
-- (Indeed, the fun part might even be not notifying them they've gone grimdark but having it apparent to other players)
- Battlefield Rebellion. Not sure of effects.

Current list of to-do tasks:
- Make items print out their abilities
-- This can be done by having them print the status display they inflict
-- e.g. "This item inflicts: Timestop: <Timestop message in displayfunctions.php>"
- Look into dungeon multiplayer
- "aspect" consumable tag that makes it only usable by people with a certain Aspect.
- Second Mind roletech, maybe
- MediaWiki wiki
-- Already done, I need kitty or thellere to fix the image bugs and give Makin privileges, and it'll be ready to go live
- Session randomizer
- message system?
- mass item dropper
- Is there any way to edit items you have submitted the item creator page suggested as such
- auto-captchalogue option for alchemized items
- mass alchemy
- view wearable stats
- the grist type tiers should be shown in the quick item creator
- holopad functionality somewhere
- Better streamlining for turning quick-created items into "real" ones.
- please please PLEASE include search buttons in captchaloguing from storage and item catalog
- Multiple submissions per player
- Storage page?
- Denizen Dungeon
- Make the Saigyouji Fan not suck
- SOMETHING to make aspect patterns less overpoweringly good against bosses
- Ideas for ways to fix the inventory while still keeping the cool new look:
-- Make the box horizontal instead of vertical.?

To investigate:
- I think there may be something wrong with the punch designix sburb item.
- I have it in my storage in one of my sessions, and it doesn't show up on the SBURB Client page as a usable item.
- In another session, I tried to deploy it to my client, and the error message given was "Deploy failed: client lacks the required ."
- As a result, canon alchemy is totally busted.
-- ddsp reports that this is due to "7 grist" issues.
-- Additionally, there's no code for using the designix in the first place!
