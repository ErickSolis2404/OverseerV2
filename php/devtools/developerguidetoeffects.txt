- NOTE: "Damage" refers to once offense and defense have been calculated and it is determined that an attack is getting through for damage.

---WEAPON EFFECTS---

Affinity
- Format on weapon: AFFINITY:<type>:<percentage>|
- Adds <percentage>% damage
- Bonus damage is resisted by a resistance of <type>
- Example: AFFINITY:Void:20| deals 20% extra damage, affected by Void resistance.

Randamage
- Format on weapon: RANDAMAGE:<%variance>|
- Damage inflicted varies between (100 - variance)% and (100 + variance)%
- Example: A RANDAMAGE:50| weapon deals between 50% and 150% of the damage it would otherwise do.

Lifesteal
- Format on weapon: LIFESTEAL:<%chance>:<%absorbed>|
- Has a <chance>% chance to restore <absorbed>% of damage done as health to the attacker
- Blood resistance applies to Lifesteal. Blood resistance higher than 100 causes Lifesteal to damage the user.
- Example: A LIFESTEAL:10:10| weapon has a 10% chance to restore 10% of damage done by attacks with the weapon

Knockdown
- Format on weapon: KNOCKDOWN:<%multiplier>|
- Has a chance to apply KNOCKDOWN to struck enemies. KNOCKDOWN prevents the enemy from attacking next turn.
- The chance is equal to four times the percentage of the enemy's max health that the attack did, multiplied by <multiplier>
- Hence, a KNOCKDOWN:100| weapon is guaranteed to knock down on a hit of 25% of the target's max health
- Breath resistance applies to knockdown. An enemy with 100 or more resistance is immune.
- Example: A KNOCKDOWN:200| weapon, upon dealing 5% of an enemy's maximum health in one strike, has a 40% chance to knock them down.

Apply Status Effect
- Format on weapon: <status string>:<chance>:<resistance>:<message>|
- <status string> is added to a struck enemy's status field if the effect succeeds. Colons (:) must be replaced by @.
- <chance> is the chance of effect success, expressed as a percentage (1 to 100)
- <resistance> is the resistance that applies to the effect's application, reducing the chance of it (immunity at a resist of 100 or higher)
- <resistance> will be the resistance that applies against the underlying status effect, if any.
- If no resistance applies against the underlying effect, a recommended resistance will be suggested in the effect's listing
- <resistance> can be "Unresisted" for an unresistable effect. The status applied may still be affected by resistance.
- <message> is the message that is displayed when the effect hits.
- <message> may contain %USER% and %TARGET% and they will be replaced by the attacker and defender respectively
- Example: A weapon with TIMESTOP@2:20:Time:%USER% freezes %TARGET% in time!| inflicts "TIMESTOP:2|" on struck enemies 20% of the time

---OTHER EFFECTS---

Readable
- Format on item: READ:<reference>|
- Looks up the "Reading" table and prints out the referenced text when the reading action is used with the item.

---LIST OF STATUS EFFECTS---

General notes:
- Duration will tick down at the end of the turn the status is applied
- The status will not apply during the turn it is inflicted
- Thus, a status with a duration of 1 on a weapon will apply only at the end of the round it is inflicted (and then expire)
- Hence a weapon that inflicts "TIMESTOP:2|" causes time stop for 1 round
- Hence "TIMESTOP:1|" does nothing in practice, but "BURNING:1:100|" will inflict 100 damage from the burn before expiring immediately.
- A duration of 0 causes the status effect to last for the entire strife (no TIMESTOP:0| weapons, please)
- As noted above, to have a weapon apply a desired status effect use the "Apply status effect" template, replacing : with @ in the desired string
- This means setting <status string> to exactly what you want to show up in the enemy's status field if the weapon procs (replacing : with @)
- Unless otherwise stated, status effects stack.
- However, some effects don't do anything interesting when stacked
- Example: Two instances of TIMESTOP:1| will both deny the enemy their current turn and then disappear. Net result is the same as if they only had one.
- A weapon that applies a POSITIVE status effect is possible as a drawback to a powerful weapon. Likewise negative status effects and wearables.
- However, be wary of things like "give extra attacks to an enemy that can't hit the player because their weapon is OP"

- Thus, anywhere we want a @ in the effect string, we will instead put &
- Example: HASEFFECT:0:TIMESTOP&2@20@Time@%USER% freezes %TARGET% in time!|
- This gives the strifer an on-hit effect of TIMESTOP@2:20:Time:%USER% freezes %TARGET% in time!|
