ALTER TABLE Characters ADD notifications LONGTEXT NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE Characters ADD notif_history LONGTEXT NOT NULL;

##HOW TO USE

notifySession(the sender's charrow, 'message'). Notifies your session mates. Customize the message as you see fit.
Check addcharacter.php for an example.

notifyCharacter(the receiver's character **ID**, 'message'). Notifies a single character. Important to note this shouldn't be used when it can be spammed.

notifyCharacterOnce(the sender's charrow, the receiver's character ID, 'message'). Notifies a single character and checks for uniqueness.

You don't need to check for duplicates yourself, the function handles that and will only send any specific message once.
